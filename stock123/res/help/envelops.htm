<h2>Moving Average Envelopes</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Moving Average Envelopes are percentage-based envelopes set above and below a moving average. The moving average, which forms the base for this indicator, can be a simple or exponential moving average. Each envelope is then set the same percentage above or below the moving average. This creates parallel bands that follow price action. With a moving average as the base, Moving Average Envelopes can be used as a trend following indicator. However, this indicator is not limited to just trend following. The envelopes can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
Calculation for Moving Average Envelopes is straight-forward. First, choose a simple moving average or exponential moving average. Second, select the number of time periods for the moving average. Third, set the percentage for the envelopes. A 20-day moving average with a 2.5% envelope would show the following two lines: 
<br>
<br>
<b>
*Upper Envelope: 20-day SMA + (20-day SMA x .025)
<br>
*Lower Envelope: 20-day SMA - (20-day SMA x .025)
</b>

The chart above shows IBM with a 20-day SMA and 2.5% envelopes. Note that the 20-day SMA was added to this SharpChart for reference. Notice how the envelopes move parallel with the 20-day SMA. They remain a constant 2.5% above and below the moving average. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
The parameters for the Moving Average Envelopes depend on your trading/investing objectives and the characteristics of the security involved. Traders will likely use shorter (faster) moving averages and relatively tight envelopes. Investors will likely prefer longer (slower) moving averages with wider envelopes. 
<br>
<br>
A security's volatility will also influence the parameters. Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels have built in mechanisms that automatically adjust to a security's volatility. Bollinger Bands use the standard deviation to set bandwidth. Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set channel width. These automatically adjust for volatility. Chartists must independently account for volatility when setting the Moving Average Envelopes. Securities with high volatility will require wider bands to encompass most price action. Securities with low volatility can use narrower bands.

In choosing the right parameters, it often helps to overlay a few different Moving Average Envelopes and compare. The chart above shows the S&P 500 ETF with three Moving Average Envelopes based on the 20-day SMA. The 2.5% envelopes (red) were touched several times, the 5% envelopes (green) were only touched during the July surge. The 10% envelopes (pink) were never touched, which means this band is too wide. A medium-term trader might use the 5% envelopes, while a short-term trader could use the 2.5% envelopes.

<h3>Trend Identification</h3>
Moving Average Envelopes can be used to identify strong moves that signal the start of an extended trend. The trick, as always, is picking the correct parameters. This takes practice, trial and error. The chart below shows Dow Chemical (DOW) with the Moving Average Envelopes (20,10). Closing prices are used because moving averages are calculated with closing prices. Some chartists prefer bars or candlesticks to utilize the intraday day high and low. Notice how DOW surged above the upper envelope in mid July and continued moving above this envelope until early August. This shows extraordinary strength. Also note that the Moving Average Envelopes turned up and followed the advance. After a move from 14 to 23, the stock was clearly overbought. However, this move established a strong precedent that marked the beginning of an extended trend.

<br>
With DOW becoming overbought soon after establishing its uptrend, it was time to wait for a playable pullback. Traders can look for pullbacks with basic chart analysis or with indicators. Pullbacks often come in the form of falling flags or wedges. DOW formed a picture perfect falling flag in August and broke resistance in September. Another flag formed in late October with a breakout in November. After the November surge, the stock pulled back with a five week flag into December. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is shown in the indicator window. Moves below -100 show oversold readings. When the bigger trend is up, oversold readings can be used to identify pullbacks to improve the risk-reward profile for a trade. Momentum turns bullish again when CCI moves back into positive territory (green dotted lines).
<br><br>
The inverse logic can be applied for a downtrend. A strong move below the lower envelope signals extraordinary weakness that can foreshadow an extended downtrend. The chart below shows International Game Tech (IGT) breaking below the 10% envelope to establish a downtrend in late October 2009. Because the stock was quite oversold after this sharp decline, it would have been prudent to wait for a bounce. We can then use basic price analysis or another momentum indicator to identify bounces.

<h3>Overbought/Oversold</h3>
Measuring overbought and oversold conditions is tricky. Securities can become overbought and remain overbought in a strong uptrend. Similarly, securities can become oversold and remain oversold in a strong downtrend. In a strong uptrend, prices often move above the upper envelope and continue above this line. In fact, the upper envelope will rise as price continues above the upper envelope. This may seem technically overbought, but it is a sign of strength to remain overbought. The reverse is true for oversold. Overbought and oversold readings are best used when the trend flattens.

The chart for Nokia has it all. The pink lines represent the Moving Average Envelopes (50,10). A 50-day simple moving average is in the middle (red). The envelopes are set 10% above and below this moving average. The chart starts with an overbought level that stayed overbought as a strong trend emerged in April-May. Price action turned choppy from June to April, which is the perfect scenario for overbought and oversold levels. Overbought levels in September and mid March foreshadowed reversals. Similarly, oversold levels in August and late October foreshadowed advances. The chart ends with an oversold condition that remains oversold as a strong downtrend emerges.

Overbought and oversold conditions should serve as alerts for further analysis. Overbought levels should be confirmed with chart resistance. Chartists can also look for bearish patterns to reinforce reversal potential at overbought levels. Similarly, oversold levels should be confirmed with chart support. Chartist can also look for bullish patterns to reinforce reversal potential at oversold levels.
